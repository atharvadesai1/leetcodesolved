# Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

# A valid BST is defined as follows:

# The left 
# subtree
#  of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

class TreeNode(object):
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def isValidBST(root):
    pass

root = TreeNode()
root.val = 5
root.left = TreeNode()
